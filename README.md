**Welcome to UK Delivers.**

UK Delivers is a simple directory of independent businesses offering local delivery. Enabling people to stay at home and save lives, while keeping our high streets alive.

This project was originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
